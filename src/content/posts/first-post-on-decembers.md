Yes, because I don't know what to write, so what do I want to type in here hahaha.

It seems that it has been 1 month since I haven't written an article here because of a busy life in the real life, And the fun of playing your favorite games, how are you, your gacha, you will definitely get SSR right?

Incidentally, last night they got them ... uh, it's not because of the gacha, but we used the "chooseable character" ticket so I choose them, wow :o. How's the gacha in the next game? no need to ask hahaha
