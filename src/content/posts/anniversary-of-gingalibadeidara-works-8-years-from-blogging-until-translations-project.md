Hello, I'm finally back here. As the title says, I want to tell you how this project started. Initially this project used to be a fad project that started with blogging and started in 2013 when I was still in junior high school.

## - BLOGGING
![Ameba Blog](https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/g/gingalibadeidara/20220228/20220228111139.png)
The first time I tried blogging on a Japanese blogger platform, let's call it "ameba" at that time just uploaded a random picture and school activities. And in mid 2014 I decided to change the URL due to wrong username setting, stay on the same platform. Then I was confused about how to use the blog platform, so one of my friends on Facebook gave me the easiest blog platform url.

## - DEVIANTART
I used to just make it for fun, I thought "it's better if I create an account so I can save some bookmarks from other users" yep, at first I used that account to look for Naruto fanart, especially from one user named "Goriverde". In 2016 I have started to upload several works starting from design then Line Art and so on.

Vector project started in 2019 until now. Oh, yes, before that I also made LineArt in one of the software to draw "Paint Tool Sai" in August 2017 to mid 2019.

## - Skinning & Themeing
One of the first projects I started was making a Winrar theme, definitely familiar with this one software, and then proceeded to the browser theme.

## - Translation Project

Actually, it has been active since 2017, at which time there was a platform that offered users to translate "want the application/software to be in your language" I was very interested, but not long after it was removed from there, finally there was one software that opened a vacancy translation contributor, finally I tried to join with other contributors.

Now it's 8 years old for a fun project, I didn't realize that 2013 wasn't official yet. Now don't know what to do. This is a future video project, and it's not finished yet.
