here I will show you how to install and play one of the games that are currently being played by my friends or myself. Call it "Mahjong Soul" but on desktop like Princess Connect Re: Dive or another Anime Games (Granblue Fantasy).

What do you need to run this? Yes, you need software called NodeJs, so you can download via this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

Install as usual (because here I have installed it, so I just skip it). Download the repository via the following link and extract it anywhere.

After extracting all the files, run a terminal windows or cmd in the folder like this.

so type command line on cmd npm install like this and just wait untill process done.

when finished for the installation, you just type npm start to start game
![run](https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/g/gingalibadeidara/20220429/20220429094004.png)
